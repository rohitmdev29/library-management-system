# library-management-system
A simple Java console-based Library Management System for managing books and patrons, including features like checkout, return, and late fee calculation.


Some Extenions:-
Late fee is â‚¹10 per day after the due date.
Checkout period is fixed at 14 days.
Currently, a book can be checked out by only one patron at a time.

This project follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle with a clean, modular design. Core features like book checkout and return use straightforward logic, and the use of POJOs and preloaded data ensures simplicity and ease of testing.

ðŸ—‚ Project Structure:-
com.rohitmdev29.library
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ Test.java       // Main class with console menu interface
â”œâ”€â”€ Library.java    // Core logic for managing books and patrons 
â”œâ”€â”€ Book.java       // Represents a Book entity.
â””â”€â”€ Patron.java     // Represents a Patron entity (library user).



Preloaded Data:-
When the application starts, it comes with a few books and patrons already added for testing and demo purposes.
